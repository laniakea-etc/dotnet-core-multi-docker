# .Net Core version of the "Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide" course - Complex solution (multi Docker containers)

> source code for the .Net Core version of the "Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide" course - Complex solution (multi Docker containers)

## Build Setup

## execute it locally

$ docker-compose up --build

Navigate to http://localhost:3050/

## Continuous Integration with Travis CI + Amazon AWS

- The repository must be created on https://github.com/

- The repository must be assigned from GitHub on https://travis-ci.com/. The following setting variables must be set up:
1) AWS_ACCESS_KEY
2) AWS_SECRET_KEY
3) DOCKER_ID
4) DOCKER_PASSWORD

- The following instances must be created on Amazon EWS
1) Elastic Beanstalk (EB)
2) Relational Database Service (RDS) for Postgres
3) ElastiCache for Redis
4) Custom Security Group
5) Identity and Access Magagement (IAM)

## Within the code you can see how to
- Create different Docket Container Types and relate all of them
  1) React Client App
  2) .NET Core Web API
  3) .NET Core Console
  4) Postgres
  5) Redis
  6) NGINX
- Use Postgres from a Docker Container with .Net Core
- Use Redis from a Docker Container with .Net Core creating a subscription on the Web API App and subscribe to it on the Console App.
- Accept dynamic POST request with .Net Core API
- Send dynamic JSON responses from .Net Core API
- Use Docker Compose to run and relate easily different Docker Components
- Use NIGIX Container to run the React Client App
- Use NIGIX Container as Reverse Proxy with .NET Core API
- Work with different Amazon EWS service types.
- Updload own Containers to Docker Hub and download them when deploying
- Use Travis CI for the Continuous Integration Workflow
